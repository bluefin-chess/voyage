# Voyage
*Voyage* is a chess move generator, made for our *Bluefin* engine. The namesake is for the voyage that Bluefin tuna make across the Pacific Ocean.

It is a bitboard move generator, based on [D. Infeuhr](https://www.codeproject.com/Members/dangi12012)'s incredible article [Worlds Fastest Bitboard Chess Movegenerator](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5313417/Worlds-Fastest-Bitboard-Chess-Movegenerator).
